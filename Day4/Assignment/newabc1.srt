1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,499
Sub by Amir Shumal.

1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,499
This is my story.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,979
Right.

3
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,619
My, my, my, Delilah.

4
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,539
Why, why, why, Delilah?

5
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,619
I could see that girl was no good for me

6
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,939
but I was lost like a slave
that no man could free.

7
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,339
I saw the light on the night
that I passed by her window.

8
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,299
I saw the flickering shadow
of love on her blind.

9
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,419
She was my woman.

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:53,620
As she betrayed me I watched
and went out of my mind.

11
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,099
My, my, my, Delilah.

12
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,699
Why, why, why, Delilah?

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,979
I could see that girl was no good for me

14
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,139
but I was lost like a slave
that no man could free.

15
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,299
At break of day when that man
drove away, I was waiting.

16
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,539
I crossed the street to her
house and she opened the door.

17
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,299
She stood there laughing.

18
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,859
I felt the knife in my hand
and she laughed no more.

19
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,939
My, my, my, Delilah.

20
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,899
Why, why, why, Delilah?

21
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,860
So before they come to
break down the door

22
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,819
forgive me Delilah,
I just couldn't take any more.

23
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,380
Mr Capello?

24
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,380
Mr Capello, my pay's short.

25
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,460
Well, you're short so now you match.

26
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,620
I mean, it's supposed to
be £25 and it's not £25.

27
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,260
- So sue me.
- It's supposed to be £25 and it's not.

28
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,820
You're more than welcome to go and
see if Zippo's will pay you any more.

29
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,979
Now, beggar off. We're on.

30
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,500
Well, what about... cooking?

31
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,180
Cooking? Definitely no cooking.

32
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,739
What, no cooking?

33
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,259
I told you!

34
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,899
No cooking even with a frying pan?

35
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,260
I told you, no cooking!

36
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,179
Alright, it's a deal. No cooking.

37
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,860
Alright, now fuck off.

38
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,019
Nello, ladies and gentlemen!

39
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,820
Can I help you?

40
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,460
Yes, I'm a friend of the Bishop.

41
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,980
And... which Bishop would that be?

42
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,020
Bishop of Keele. Bishop of Lichfield.

43
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,020
And the Archbishop of Canterbury
is also a very good friend of mine.

44
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,179
Could you give me a lift?

45
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,380
Of course, of course.
Where would you need a lift to, exactly?

46
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,179
Stoke-on-Trent.

47
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,260
Right. Well, that's quite a drive!

48
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,100
It is, yes. Thank you.

49
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,659
- I didn't necessarily say that I'd...
- Have you had your breakfast?

50
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,940
- I have indeed.
- Oh. I haven't.

51
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,419
Very nice of you to ask. Thanks.

52
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,420
Right.

53
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,340
Yes.

54
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,580
Ok.

55
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,139
Ok, thank you.

56
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,620
I can take you as far as Dumfries

57
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,060
and then your mum has arranged for your
local vicar to come and get you from there.

58
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,420
Marvellous.

59
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,820
You've got a tow bar, haven't you?

60
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,579
A tow bar?

61
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,739
Why would I need a tow bar?

62
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,699
Is there any more toast?

63
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,860
Should he be wandering around
the country on his own like this?

64
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,700
He's clearly got special
needs of some sort.

65
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,220
Well, he doesn't have much
trouble finding help.

66
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,980
In fact, he seems positively
blessed in that regard.

67
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,259
Is he in the habit of doing this?

68
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,460
Well, he does seem to view the Church
as being some sort of ecclesiastical AA.

69
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,540
Oh.

70
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,860
He says he's a good friend
of the Bishop of Lichfield.

71
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,940
Yes, that's true.

72
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,460
And the Archbishop of Canterbury.

73
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,140
Well, if Neil says he knows someone,
then he usually does.

74
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,539
How does he get to know them?

75
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,219
By being Neil.

76
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,780
Thanks!

77
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,180
Oh, that's quite alright.

78
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,259
Er, would you mind signing
this before you go?

79
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,539
A Bible?

80
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,060
Are you sure? Slightly irregular.

81
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,739
Thanks.

82
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,500
No, not the front.

83
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,900
Er, that's for Bishops and Archbishops.

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,819
There's space above that
for regular clergy.

85
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,500
Right.

86
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,339
So there is.

87
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,700
I've got them all in there.

88
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,500
Desmond Tutu, Terry Waite...

89
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,980
Rowan Williams, Jimmy Greenhoff...

90
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,099
I wasn't aware Jimmy
Greenhoff had been ordained!

91
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,700
He hasn't.

92
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,620
He scored 76 goals in 274
games for Stoke City.

93
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,100
- He was marvellous.
- Right, right, well...

94
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,899
There you are.

95
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,699
Thanks. Thank you.

96
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,660
Your mum'll be pleased to see you.

97
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,379
I bet she will.
I'll be pleased to see her.

98
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,820
The truth is,
she's not been so well lately.

99
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,339
Right.

100
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,820
And I know it's hard to
think about these things

101
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,259
but your mum's not getting any younger.

102
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,860
No, she's not.

103
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,580
None of us are.

104
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,140
And that's life.

105
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,059
So we have to make the most of it.

106
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,980
Hiya, Mum.

107
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,579
Oh, there's a sight for sore eyes.

108
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,660
Let me have a look at you.

109
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,300
So how have you been keeping without
me to keep any eye on you, like?

110
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,939
I've been tip-top, me. Tip-top.

111
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,459
It's a robin.

112
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,420
Oh, he's back, is he?

113
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,419
He was here last week.

114
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,820
I bet he missed you.

115
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,139
Bet he did.

116
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,339
That's why he's come back.

117
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,579
Neil, love.

118
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,540
When I let you join that circus,
you said they'd look after you.

119
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,460
They did look after me.

120
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,540
Just that one ringmaster
took against me.

121
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,900
It only takes one.

122
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,140
I'm nice to people and
people are nice to me.

123
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,259
And if they're not nice to me,
then they're all the people who are.

124
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,860
I won't be here forever.

125
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,620
Don't talk like that.

126
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,259
Well, we all die one day, Neil.

127
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,500
Until Jesus returns

128
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,060
and raises his sleeping
followers from death

129
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,740
and grants immortality to the faithful.

130
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,260
So there you are then.

131
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,019
Jesus 1, Mary Baldwin 0.

132
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,900
I want to know that you
can look after yourself

133
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,980
when I'm not here to do it any more.

134
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,100
Don't get taken advantage of.

135
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,779
- Hold down a job.
- I've got a job.

136
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,540
- You've been sacked.
- A new job.

137
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,539
At the university.

138
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,459
Oh, that's lovely.

139
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,499
When did they offer you this?

140
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,379
Tomorrow.

141
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,420
When you first came to
Keele were you nervous?

142
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,259
I'm never nervous.

143
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,827
Hello. I'm Neil Baldwin.

144
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:06,540
- Welcome to Keele University.
- Hello.

145
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,614
I'm Neil Baldwin.

146
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:09,900
- Welcome to Keele University.
- Alright?

147
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,749
Hello. I'm Neil Baldwin.

148
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:14,199
- Welcome to Keele University.
- Hiya.

149
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,980
Hello. I'm Neil Baldwin.
Welcome to Keele University.

150
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,380
Hiya. I'm Malcolm. Stoke City fan?

151
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,540
I am, yes. Very much so.

152
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,180
- Are you?
- Yeah.

153
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,540
Yeah, I am.

154
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,820
So, do you work here, do you?

155
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,339
Yes, I think I do.

156
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,979
Ta.

157
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,499
...an explanation for perceptual error.

158
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,460
The example of the Phantom Limb is a
pretty strong refutation of the notion

159
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,819
that our perception of reality and external
reality are one and the same thing...

160
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:40,420
...Enjoy yourself while
you're still in the pink.

161
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,700
The years go by as swiftly as a wink.

162
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,579
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself,
it's later than you think!

163
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,140
Is that a chaffinch?

164
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,500
What exactly is it that
you do up there, Neil?

165
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,020
At the university?

166
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,900
It is a chaffinch, you know.
It's got wing bars.

167
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,540
Neil Baldwin.

168
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,539
As much as I love birds, I will not be
knocked off-course by plumage talk.

169
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,540
What are you doing there, at Keele?

170
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,299
All sorts.

171
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,259
And what does it pay, this 'all sorts'?

172
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,620
Look at the birds of the air.

173
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,300
They neither sow, nor reap
nor gather into barns.

174
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,819
Yet your Heavenly Father feeds them.

175
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,500
When I started work, I read
my Bible every dinner break.

176
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,300
And they made fun of me.

177
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,859
They called me Holy Mary.

178
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,219
I could be a vicar,
then I'd be Holy Neil.

179
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,500
Is that why you don't want a normal job?

180
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,739
Because you're worried
they'll pick on you?

181
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,539
I like the Church of England.

182
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,220
I like performing.

183
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,140
I believe in God.

184
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,139
That does put you three up on most of the
Church of England clergy I've encountered.

185
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,780
But there are other
things you need, Neil.

186
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,619
Bifocals.

187
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,300
I was thinking qualifications.

188
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,540
- You alright, Nello?
- Hiya, Steve.

189
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,139
Wigan on Saturday!

190
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,060
Who's that?

191
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,020
Steve. He's a very good friend of mine.

192
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,140
You've never mentioned him before?

193
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,859
Well... I only met him yesterday.

194
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,820
Well, the good news is they are looking
for pot dippers at Susie Cooper's.

195
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,940
I used to work for Susie Cooper's.

196
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,180
I was the recipient of many a
compliment on my eye for colour.

197
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,100
I think our Neil's got the same.

198
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,380
Thank you, but it's not
what I'm looking for.

199
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,739
What are you looking for?

200
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,740
What would you like to do, Neil?

201
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,180
I'd like to manage Stoke City.

202
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,300
Or be a vicar. Either is fine.
I'm flexible.

203
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,780
Ok. And... what are you qualified to do?

204
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,259
I helped the students out at Keele.
And I'm a registered clown.

205
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,540
Are you indeed?

206
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,780
What have you gone and
brought that here for?

207
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,179
That's Nello.

208
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,539
Did you do this?

209
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,700
Just look at that paintwork!

210
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,620
Not a million miles away from ceramics.

211
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,739
That's right, he's a dab hand.

212
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,220
It's an egg of, with your make
up on, and it's registered.

213
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,580
You can sue anyone who
steals your make up.

214
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,780
I don't think Elaine wants
to hear about all that now.

215
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,540
And are there any openings
in the circus right now?

216
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,380
Not at the moment, no.

217
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,940
Charlie Cairoli's a very
good friend of mine.

218
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,660
I've got his number, if you'd like it.

219
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,380
Just say Neil said to ring him.

220
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,940
- I meant for you.
- 0272...

221
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,300
496 0725.

222
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,900
Neil!

223
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,700
Sorry. He does go off on
tangents now and then.

224
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,140
But you don't think
he has any vacancies?

225
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,140
For you.

226
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,420
No.

227
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,980
That's why I mentioned the
vicaring or football manager.

228
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,019
Doesn't have to be Stoke,
but I draw the line at Port Vale.

229
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,500
There are schemes to
help people into work

230
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,260
who otherwise might have...
difficulties.

231
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,299
Why are you telling me that?

232
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,699
Fruit Pastilles do not count
as fruit and you know it.

233
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,780
You'll be turning me
vegetarian if I'm not careful.

234
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,780
If in doubt when I'm not here,
ask Doris on the till.

235
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,740
She'll tell you what's
healthy and what's not.

236
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,900
Doris?

237
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,780
She doesn't look all that well to me.

238
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,099
She can keep an eye out for you.

239
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,100
Looks like I should be
keeping an eye on her.

240
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,739
Oh, for goodness' sake! All I want to know
is you can stand on your own two feet!

241
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,500
It's more than my life's worth, Neil.

242
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,739
I thought eggs were good for you.

243
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,940
Mary, you alright, duck?

244
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,340
Yes, yes.

245
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,699
Just the price of these tinned peaches.
Taken the wind right out of me.

246
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,979
Neil.

247
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,660
I have been praying very hard
about this, and you know what?

248
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,700
I think you're ready for
a place of your own.

249
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,660
I've got a place of my own. This place.

250
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,340
A place of your very own.
Not too far away. A little flat.

251
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,819
Move out?

252
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,020
Of my home?

253
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,780
Well, somewhere nice, you know

254
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,100
where you can start
to be more... independent

255
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,100
and manage, you know.

256
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,979
But I do manage.

257
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,699
When have I ever gone without?

258
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,900
Do you think it's God's will?

259
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,740
Well, that's a difficult one,
but I think it might be, yes.

260
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,700
Not my mum's will?

261
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,300
I think on this occasion,
as is so often the case

262
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,779
your mother's will and God's will
might be one and the same thing.

263
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,380
Is that the choir?

264
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,660
Yes. Are you joining?
We're still short of baritones.

265
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,740
I'd love to help you out more but
I've got a lot of stuff to do.

266
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,620
Oh, really? Like what?

267
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,500
I'm behind on my bird-watching.

268
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,940
The Gerry Cottle Circus are in town.

269
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,659
I'm writing an extra verse
for the Lord's Prayer.

270
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,379
You're not joking, are you?

271
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,460
There's still half your Stoke
City programmes up there.

272
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,339
I'll come back for them.

273
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,859
All grown up? My Neil.

274
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,179
Don't worry, Mum. I'll not forget you.

275
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,980
This is very kind of you, Malcolm.

276
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,940
Give to him who asks you. And from him
who wants to borrow do not turn away.

277
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,980
Matthew: 5.

278
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,900
Oh, I wouldn't say no to half
a lager at the student union.

279
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,219
Malcolm: 1.

280
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,700
You alright, Neil?

281
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,379
Yes. Let's get this over with.

282
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,819
We'll have it dark.

283
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,659
Here, Malcolm.

284
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,779
Ok.

285
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,060
Don't know how all that came loose.

286
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,859
Not got an eagle in there, have you?

287
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,299
What do you think of that?

288
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,060
What's the Neil Baldwin football
club when it's at home?

289
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,620
My own team.

290
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,739
Picked by me, managed by me,
captained by me.

291
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,940
- At least you can't be dropped.
- Exactly.

292
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,579
You're Vice President.

293
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,100
Am I? Right. Not President then?

294
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,739
Gary Lineker is President. I'm just going
to write to him to tell him the good news.

295
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,780
In other news,
Stoke City have announced...

296
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,060
the departure of their manager,
Graham Paddon

297
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,940
after just 18 games in charge.

298
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,620
The club's board thanked him for
his hard work and dedication

299
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,459
and have said they'll act quickly
to find a replacement...

300
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,499
Come in, Mark.

301
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,139
Thank you for coming.

302
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,499
I'd use my own minister but he
tends to be more in demand.

303
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,900
It is addressed to Neil.

304
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,459
I can see that. That's what worries me.

305
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,300
Remember that misunderstanding around
the payment for the coach hire?

306
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,300
I do.

307
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,100
It cast a long shadow over
the Alzheimer's picnic.

308
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,140
He isn't terribly good with money.

309
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,979
And who can forget what
Paul reminded us in Romans?

310
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,940
Indeed.

311
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,580
Owe no one anything except
to love each other.

312
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,740
I'm not sure that can be applied directly
to contemporary financial transactions.

313
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,579
I want you to steam open the envelope
and tell me what's inside it.

314
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,540
I don't know about that.

315
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,340
Well, I'm a Christadelphian
but you're Church of England.

316
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,700
How's that relevant?

317
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,139
Well, firstly, Neil is Church of England so,
spiritually speaking, he is of your flock.

318
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,537
And secondly, I think of
the Church of England

319
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:11,119
as having a less rigorous
moral code than my own.

320
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,899
What's he going to do when I'm
not here to look after him?

321
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,899
We can appoint trustees.

322
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,980
And he seems to manage.

323
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,499
He has his adventures and...

324
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,979
How much is it for?

325
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,179
You might want to bear in mind you're
talking to a woman with an enlarged aorta.

326
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,499
When was your last check-up?

327
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,699
£800.

328
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,500
Oh, I should never
have let him move out!

329
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,820
- This is my fault.
- No, Mary!

330
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,700
I'm sure there's a way of
paying this by instalments.

331
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,060
- I'll go over and see him right now.
- No, he's not there!

332
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,899
He's gone up to London.

333
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,300
Right.

334
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,459
On parliamentary business, so he said.

335
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,699
Where are you going, mate?

336
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,059
House of Commons.

337
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,019
Figures.

338
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,700
Is Tony Benn in today?

339
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,579
Couldn't tell you that, sir.

340
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,780
Well, could you not find out
if he's clocked on or not?

341
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,099
I can't move from here, I'm afraid.

342
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,260
Could you leave him this note?

343
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,619
I'm a friend of his son, Stephen's,
from Keele University.

344
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,419
Thanks.

345
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,340
Did you really meet him?

346
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,260
Yes.

347
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,659
He was very nice to me.

348
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,420
Poor Tony.

349
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,299
Poor Tony, yes.

350
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,980
Did you mention our drains to him?

351
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,739
He was very busy.

352
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,500
They've not been right since next door
did that paella for their ruby wedding.

353
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,739
No.

354
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,860
They were going to go barbeque

355
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,419
but the forecast was for low
pressure from the east.

356
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,220
£800! That's not right.

357
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,419
No, it's not right, Neil.
It's not right at all!

358
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,140
I buy an electric stamp, every week,
from the Post Office. £5.

359
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,260
Neil, that only pays off £60.

360
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,820
This is the electricity
you've actually used.

361
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,300
How do you even begin to use this much?

362
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,220
I pay a fiver a week.

363
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,220
I buy a stamp. Ask the
woman at the Post Office.

364
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,979
How do you use that much?

365
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,860
I don't.

366
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,500
The budgies do.

367
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,620
I have to keep them warm, don't I?

368
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,260
Please tell me you don't have that two-bar
electric fire on all day and night?

369
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,419
Why shouldn't I?

370
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,099
I pay it. I buy a stamp.

371
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,299
I've got it in a book somewhere.

372
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,259
- How are we going to find £800?
- Don't worry, Mum.

373
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,020
Neil, love.

374
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,819
The whole point of you moving out was
so you could learn to manage these things.

375
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,580
I'll pay it off when I
get the Stoke City job.

376
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,419
There is no Stoke City job.

377
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,499
They appointed Lou Macari as the
new manager this dinnertime.

378
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,060
Then I'll go and see him.
First thing tomorrow.

379
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,419
And Lou Macari's going to pay
your electricity bill, is he?

380
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,499
I wouldn't have thought so.
Why would he do that?

381
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,459
God bless Dad. Look after him.

382
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,859
And God bless Mum.
And let her not worry any more.

383
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,259
God bless the students.

384
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,619
And God bless Norman Barrett MBE,
of Zippo's Circus.

385
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,019
God bless Gordon Banks.

386
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,499
God bless...

387
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,459
Ken Dodd.

388
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,500
And God bless Lou Macari

389
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,460
and help him in his task to return
Stoke City to the top division.

390
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,019
Amen.

391
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,579
Or to the play-offs, at least.

392
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,659
For like Job we have
been sorely destined.

393
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:41,739
Why, why, why, Delilah?

394
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,899
So before...

395
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,980
- You can take us up, Lou.
- I hope so. I really hope so.

396
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,940
No, I mean I know you will.

397
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,380
Aye, good, great. Aye. Top man.

398
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,100
I told my vicar he'll make Bishop one day,
and I'll be right about that too.

399
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,699
Aye, right, great.
That's... that's great.

400
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,939
- Macari!
- Macari!

401
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,780
Not been waiting out
there all day, have you?

402
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,820
I have, yeah.

403
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,140
In case you needed me, like.

404
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,900
That's very good of you,
but have you not got work to do?

405
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,339
I'm out of work at the moment.

406
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,900
I'm sorry to hear that.

407
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,460
And what's your trade?

408
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,900
Circus clown.

409
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,180
Alright.

410
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,739
And what was your act?

411
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,620
Making people happy, you know.

412
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,860
I used to get chucked off the
back of a fire engine every night.

413
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,979
So how come you got sacked?

414
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,459
Face didn't fit.

415
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,180
Night, then.

416
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,379
Night.

417
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,539
A clown, you say?

418
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,379
How do you fancy coming to work for me?

419
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,780
Kit man?

420
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,820
It'd be great, yeah.

421
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,540
I'll have to square it with the university,
like, but I think they'll be alright with it.

422
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,700
What do you do at the university?

423
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,980
Help them out. With the students.

424
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,540
What, you don't get flung off the
back of a fire truck there as well?

425
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,460
No, it's not really called for.

426
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,699
I suppose not.

427
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,780
Well, I'll see you on Monday then, aye?

428
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,979
See you Monday, Lou.

429
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,739
Top man.

430
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,699
Are you absolutely sure
you've got this right, Neil?

431
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,220
The manager of Stoke City, Mr Lou Macari

432
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,300
offering you, Neil Baldwin, a job?

433
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,219
Mr Lou Macari of Manchester
United and Scotland, yes.

434
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,740
I'm starting a file on him.

435
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,460
You want a biscuit?

436
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,620
No, but you have one. Don't make crumbs.

437
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,539
You can only just see the
pattern on the carpet as it is.

438
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,499
I know better than anyone
how much you love football.

439
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,659
I know you love football because of me.

440
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,259
It's just that...

441
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,339
What exactly does it entail, this job?

442
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,020
Laying out the clean kit,
picking up the dirty kit

443
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,700
taking it to the laundry.

444
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,659
Well, you had me
believing you 'til then.

445
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,899
You've never so much as picked up
a dirty sock in your lifetime.

446
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,179
Your bedroom's like the
hold in Noah's ark.

447
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,660
Are you sure you've got that right?

448
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,180
Are you sure you've got this right?

449
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,819
Tell the boss Nello's here.

450
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,739
What can I say?
He was the right man for the job.

451
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,499
Thank you very much.

452
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,099
Come on.

453
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,220
O ye of little faith.

454
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,899
Wherefore didst thou doubt?

455
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,899
Matthew: 14.

456
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,020
Come on, out of the way!

457
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,820
You don't want any more injuries!

458
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,180
Who's that?

459
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,979
New kit man.

460
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,060
Keep it tight.

461
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,860
Get in behind that lumbering
fullback of theirs.

462
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,300
Defending corners we leave Laino up.

463
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,940
But we need to get tight on
their two big lads at corners.

464
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,979
Paddy, you stick to that big fella like glue.
Alright? Don't let him breathe.

465
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,180
First to the ball.
Don't give them time or space.

466
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,580
Now, we do that in the first 10
minutes and they won't worry us.

467
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,939
Laino. What?

468
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,259
What is it, son?

469
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,659
Oh, for fuck's sake!

470
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,940
Get in here, you!

471
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,659
What the fuck, what the fuck,
what the fucking hell is that?

472
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,180
Well done, lads.
Great stuff out there today!

473
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,140
Well played, Paddy, son.

474
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,779
Well played, lads.

475
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,499
Oh fuck off!

476
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,859
Kick him out! He's trying to cheat!
He's trying to cheat!

477
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,819
I took the head off.

478
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,140
Just in time, by the looks of you.

479
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,179
Bloody hell, Nello. A few spuds round
you and you make a roast dinner.

480
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,420
I talked a girl out of
killing herself once.

481
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,180
Young student.

482
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,539
What, dressed as a chicken?

483
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,140
No, course not.

484
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,060
Dressed as Father Christmas.

485
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,699
Oh, right.

486
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,459
And what's that got to
do with the chicken suit?

487
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,899
Fancy dress. Good for morale.

488
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,620
Charlie Cairoli taught me that.

489
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,019
He's a very good friend of mine.

490
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,059
Just out of interest

491
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,259
what did you say to that girl
who wanted to kill herself?

492
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:28,859
I said, 'we've all got to go sometime,
love, but why do you have to go now'?

493
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,779
Night.

494
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,900
- Alright, gorgeous?
- Alright.

495
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,060
- Ey up, how's it going, Nello?
- Good, yeah.

496
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,939
Nello! Nello!

497
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,620
Alright, mong?

498
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,939
Make sure that tea's ready
and waiting for tomorrow.

499
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,860
I'm not a mong.

500
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,299
I'm a registered clown.

501
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,380
That was a bit harsh.

502
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,539
You've got to carry on.

503
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,340
Didn't you feel he was picking on you?

504
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,940
Because of your difficulties?

505
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,179
What difficulties?

506
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,299
O Lord my God

507
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:43,499
when I in awesome wonder consider
all the works thy hand hath made

508
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,540
I see the stars

509
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,620
I hear the mighty thunder

510
00:38:52,720 --> 00:39:00,139
thy power throughout
the universe displayed.

511
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:08,139
Then sings my soul,
my Saviour God, to thee

512
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,179
how great thou art, how great thou art!

513
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,499
Then sings my soul,
my Saviour God, to thee

514
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:33,379
how great thou art, how great thou art!

515
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,579
...You fat bastard! You fat bastard!

516
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:58,020
When I look down from
lofty mountain grandeur

517
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:05,539
and hear the brook,
and feel the gentle breeze.

518
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,059
Then sings my soul,
my Saviour God, to thee...

519
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,099
- A shock signing?
- Well, he's a bit of an unknown quantity.

520
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,940
I don't even really want
to reveal his name.

521
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,780
Er, we'll let him do his
own talking on the pitch.

522
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,140
And he'll be given an opportunity
at pre-season matches.

523
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,299
We've got to get some weight off him.

524
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,260
Er, he's not in the best of condition.

525
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,419
But you know, I put my head
on the chopping block and...

526
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,740
and have taken that opportunity
and brought him here.

527
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,660
Let's just see what lies ahead, Ivan.

528
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,659
Let's just take it from game to game.

529
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,619
Well, he's, er... He's Neil, isn't he?

530
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,539
You know what I mean.

531
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,339
I know. Neil, my son. Yes.

532
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,420
But he's just great to have around.

533
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,340
He's, er, well, he's funny.

534
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,580
He doesn't always mean to be.

535
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,899
Aye, well that does make
it a wee bit funnier.

536
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,980
If you don't mind me saying.

537
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,739
No, not at all.

538
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,620
...couldn't fucking turn on
a fucking manhole cover.

539
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,139
You've got love handles like my
missus and she's six months pregnant!

540
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,699
Alright, Nello, got a
fucking brew on, or what?

541
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,619
Sorry about that, Mrs Baldwin.

542
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,020
Where were we?

543
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,899
You were telling me why
you've given my Neil a job.

544
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,859
Well, he's... he's genuine.

545
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,420
He doesn't have an angle.

546
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,220
And you go a long way in this game
to find a bloke without an angle.

547
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,300
And the fact that...

548
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,980
well, that he isn't perhaps
as quick on the uptake...

549
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,540
Quick on the uptake?

550
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,140
We're talking about
footballers here, Mrs Baldwin.

551
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,619
It's not exactly University
Challenge out there.

552
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,180
Even so, I had thought...

553
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,740
Well...

554
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,059
I won't be around forever,
and I have to be sure he'll be alright.

555
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,020
Of course.

556
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,900
What mother wouldn't want that?

557
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,820
I had put his name down for a monastery,
for when I'm not here, to keep an eye.

558
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,100
He seemed to like it there.

559
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,660
A monastery?

560
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,020
Neil?

561
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,980
Your son belongs in a
changing room, Mrs Baldwin.

562
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,019
He loves it here. And we love him.

563
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,979
God, he gives us all a lift.
And he's... indispensable.

564
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,140
- Paddy.
- Yes, boss.

565
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,020
You'll do for me, young man.

566
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,340
Thanks, boss.

567
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,380
- Laino.
- Yes, boss.

568
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,060
Just play.

569
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,540
How should I play, boss?

570
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,700
Play well.

571
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,380
And as for you, Thumper.

572
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,940
Bomber, boss.

573
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,699
I think you'll find Thumper's
the name of the rabbit in Bambi.

574
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,500
I'm the boss.

575
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,100
If I call you Thumper,
your name's Thumper.

576
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,500
Right, boss.

577
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,580
Let's just play the game right.

578
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,380
And the main thing is this

579
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,659
this is what you've got
to get into your noggins.

580
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:36,779
The main thing is: go out there and
score more goals than the other team.

581
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,340
Thanks, Nello.

582
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,819
Was that supposed to be me, aye?

583
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,620
Brian Clough, boss.

584
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,299
Oh right. Cloughy.

585
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,140
Lou says I should give the
team talk every week.

586
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,460
3 - 0, not surprised!

587
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,220
There might be a problem this week.

588
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,940
It's the boat race.
I never miss the boat race.

589
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,620
Can't you tape it?

590
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,500
I don't watch it on the telly.

591
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,259
I'm on the river.

592
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,860
You might need to lose some
weight if you're coxing.

593
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,700
I'm not in the crews.

594
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,620
I'm on the launch behind
with the umpire and that.

595
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,180
Hi, Neil.

596
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,100
Hiya, Molly.

597
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,379
How'd you wangle that?

598
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,540
I just asked.

599
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,460
You can't just get things by asking.

600
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,139
Can't you?

601
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,820
I can.

602
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,740
Great win Saturday, Nello!

603
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,019
Up the Potters, Farouq!

604
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,340
Why would they let you
on the umpire's launch?

605
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,979
Tradition.

606
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,260
Hey, Nello. How long are you going
to be with those fucking pads?

607
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,260
Sort your own pads out.

608
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,300
Yes, Nello! Get in there!

609
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,380
You tell him, lad! You have him!

610
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,620
You flash bastard!

611
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,020
Did you put your wife's knickers
on by mistake this morning

612
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,100
or is there something
you want to tell us?

613
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,139
These are pure silk
boxer shorts, these, boss.

614
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,420
Kendall Mills, Deansgate.

615
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,580
If you're spending that much on
underpants I'm paying you too much.

616
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,060
Valuable cargo.

617
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,699
Can't keep the crown jewels
in a cornflakes box.

618
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,019
Hey, how much do you spend
on your underpants, Nello?

619
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,540
Nothing.

620
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,540
My mum buys them for me.

621
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,500
Very wise.

622
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,419
Might be because you're protecting
as little as possible, mate.

623
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,380
Well.

624
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,500
They weren't very nice to you.

625
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,779
There's always banter.

626
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,620
Nello. Nello!

627
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,899
Yes, boss?

628
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,779
Have you put on weight?

629
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,580
A bit.

630
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,340
Your mother will kill me.

631
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,899
I promised her I'd help you lose weight.

632
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,180
Hey, come on! Laino, I told you!

633
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,659
First touch! First touch!

634
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,900
Where the fuck are my boxer shorts?

635
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,340
Which one of you bastards has had them?

636
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,740
Sixty fucking quid's worth.
That must be a blow.

637
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,220
Hang on!

638
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,940
My pants have gone too. What the fuck!

639
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,620
Some thieving YTS lad has definitely
had them off. Million percent.

640
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,900
Yeah, that'll be it, yeah.

641
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,340
Those YTS boys, they'll steal
anything that isn't nailed down.

642
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,139
Who asked you?

643
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,099
No. No, Nello, you haven't?

644
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,859
Yours are on the bottom,
and they're a waste of money.

645
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,100
They're chafing right up
my undercarriage.

646
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,699
Oh fuck!

647
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,619
My, my, my, Delilah!

648
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,220
Why, why, why, Delilah?

649
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,820
So before they come to
break down the door

650
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,499
forgive me Delilah,
I just couldn't take any more.

651
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:10,259
So before they come to
break down the door

652
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:17,419
forgive me Delilah,
I just couldn't take any more.

653
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,219
Mum?

654
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,420
- Her eyes aren't what they were.
- Mary, can you watch this light for me?

655
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,179
She has bifocals.

656
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,620
Do you know where you are?

657
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,180
I don't think either of them are right.

658
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,779
Do you know where you are?

659
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,340
- My dad died here.
- Hold my hand, Mrs Baldwin.

660
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,140
- When he was young.
- Can you grip it tight?

661
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,900
And I was young too.

662
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,680
- That's good.
- I did very well.

663
00:49:03,781 --> 00:49:05,619
And the other hand,
can you do that one too?

664
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,460
She has bifocals.

665
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,580
She's very healthy. I'm not so healthy.

666
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,860
She eats salad. I eat chips.

667
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,540
She's always telling me.

668
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,260
We're going to get a consultant
down to look at her.

669
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,020
I'd rather it was a doctor.

670
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,940
He's better than a doctor.

671
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,260
When will I take her home?
I have to call a taxi.

672
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,860
She won't be going home tonight, I'm afraid.
She really is very poorly right now.

673
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,660
She is, isn't she?

674
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,780
I think we need to get that
consultant right away.

675
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,300
Yes, he's busy, but he'll be
right down as soon as possible.

676
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,019
Is it Mr Saeed?

677
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,260
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Why, do you know him?

678
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,540
He's a very good friend of mine.

679
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,820
Neil.

680
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,940
How are you? Everything ok?

681
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,340
Very well, thank you.

682
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,060
Are we going to beat
Portsmouth on Saturday?

683
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,700
If Laino's fit, we can beat anyone.

684
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,660
I love your attitude.
This man is a force for good.

685
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,020
Has my registrar been looking after you?

686
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,859
He's very young.

687
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,980
My mum has had an episode.

688
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,340
Ok.

689
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,420
Ok, well, let's see what
we can do, shall we?

690
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,180
Have you ordered a CT scan?

691
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,979
Bloods? BP? Come on,
what's been keeping you?

692
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,659
Ok.

693
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,579
Let's go and have a
look at her, shall we?

694
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,019
Third somersault... short.

695
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,963
That's the boner that cost me
the triple. Not big, but fatal.

696
00:50:26,063 --> 00:50:28,731
That's why we're gonna start from the
beginning and make each move perfect

697
00:50:28,831 --> 00:50:32,063
before we go onto the next.
I'll run it again for you.

698
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,860
Ey up, Nello! How's it going?

699
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,260
Shocking.

700
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,180
Is Laino going to be fit for Saturday?

701
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,060
Course he is, yeah.

702
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,139
Don't worry about that.

703
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,139
Thanks.

704
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,580
Now Neil, your mum has
had a heart attack.

705
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,540
And that is why the oxygen
isn't getting to her brain.

706
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,899
And that is why she's confused.

707
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,979
A heart attack. Yes.

708
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,459
So you are going to have to be strong for
your mum now because she needs you to be.

709
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,940
I'll pray for her.

710
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,939
That'd be a good idea.

711
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,540
And I'll visit.

712
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,980
Also good.

713
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,260
I'll get the Christadelphians
to pray for her too.

714
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,580
Excellent idea.

715
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,619
And you. At the temple.

716
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,140
More the merrier. That's what I say.

717
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,739
Very wise.

718
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,420
Have her home in no time?

719
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,259
Well, there is a possibility, Neil,
that she might not be able to come home.

720
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,099
Her health hasn't been very good
for a while now, as you know.

721
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,900
Social Services think they may have to
find her somewhere where she can live

722
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,059
and be looked after.

723
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,819
- Do you understand?
- I do. Yes.

724
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,939
Have her home in no time?

725
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,539
Morning, boss.

726
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,380
You take as much time
off as you need, Neil.

727
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,660
Alright?

728
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,100
There's nothing more important
than your mother's health.

729
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,299
I don't need to take any time off.
She's going to get better.

730
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,779
How do you do it, Nello?

731
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,939
How do you stay so positive?

732
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,379
I've always wanted to be
happy so I decided to be.

733
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,579
Brilliant.

734
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,059
I'm going to write some
of this stuff down!

735
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,499
If bad things happen,
you think about good things.

736
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,059
Like what?

737
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,100
Like...

738
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,019
Best signing you ever made.

739
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,939
I wouldn't know where to start.

740
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,619
With the shorts.

741
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,380
The cleaner the shorts
the better the player.

742
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,379
It means they've stayed
on their feet longer.

743
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,819
Well, if you don't mind me saying,
that's very much a kit man's point of view.

744
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,699
Cloughy thought it too.

745
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,979
Oh, so now I'm arguing with
you and Cloughy, am I?

746
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,339
I'm assuming the budgie's not
part of the food shop, son.

747
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,340
It's for me.

748
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,139
The man at the pet shop
gave me a discount.

749
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,779
I've got your shopping.

750
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,059
Did you not take a list, Neil?
I gave you a list.

751
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,420
I did it from memory.

752
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,219
Oh. Whose memory's this?

753
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,620
Not mine, that's for certain.

754
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,380
I've never eaten any of
this stuff in my life!

755
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,860
What did you pay for all this?

756
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,940
Wasn't Doris on?

757
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,500
- I've got it here somewhere.
- It doesn't matter really.

758
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,660
Just take the list next time, will you?

759
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,699
I'll write you a new one.

760
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,299
Fetch me the writing pad.

761
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,099
I've been keeping my flat clean as well.

762
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,659
Good.

763
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,660
What about you?

764
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,380
When did you last have a shave?

765
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,500
I'm going to call him Macari.

766
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,700
Who?

767
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,259
My budgie.

768
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,099
I'm going to call him Macari,
after Lou Macari.

769
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,459
Right.

770
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,099
Everything has to start
and end with love.

771
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,019
It's a simple message, but one
that we can forget all too easily.

772
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,699
Now, as it says in Corinthians: 1

773
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,299
'If I speak in the tongues of mortals
and angels but do not have love'

774
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,339
'I am a noisy gong or clashing cymbal.'

775
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,619
Now I think we've all encountered
one or two noisy gongs in our lives.

776
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,220
You are looking after yourself,
aren't you, Neil?

777
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,459
Yes, I am.

778
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,179
I always have.

779
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,340
Well, with your mum
in the home and so on

780
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,579
I can't help noticing... well...

781
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,180
I think you need to maybe
take extra care of yourself.

782
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,059
So your mum doesn't worry
too much about you.

783
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,300
I've got the Lord.

784
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,139
You have indeed.

785
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,140
I've got the students.

786
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,020
Yes.

787
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,179
I've got Stoke City and I've got my mum.

788
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,979
What I want you to think about, Neil

789
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,140
is what you would do

790
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,379
if one of them wasn't there.

791
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,299
Well, I'd probably have the time
to join the choir, for a start.

792
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,219
Right.

793
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,020
Right!

794
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,419
Are you feeling better
for our little chat, Mark?

795
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,379
Yes.

796
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,299
Thank you, Neil.

797
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,900
...Police would like to talk to anyone

798
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,420
who was in the area in the
early hours of Sunday morning.

799
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,500
More on that breaking story now.

800
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,740
We go over to the Victoria ground

801
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,860
where Lou Macari has resigned
as Stoke City manager

802
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,740
to take up the vacant
post at Glasgow Celtic.

803
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,779
The club have said they have already begun
their search for a first-class successor.

804
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,980
I've no comments to make right now.

805
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,820
But... there'll be a press
conference later on.

806
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,939
So you can check that out,
see how we go. Alright?

807
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,580
During his time at the club

808
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,619
Macari took the Potters to the play-offs,
automatic promotion...

809
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,019
Nello.

810
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:56,659
When Celtic come calling,
a Glasgow boy like me has to say yes.

811
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,499
I know that, yes.

812
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:05,219
And whoever takes over here,
I bet they'll find you as valuable as I did.

813
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,580
Do you want me to come? To Celtic?

814
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,340
Oh, I'd love you to.

815
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,779
But I think you're Stoke,
through and through.

816
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,860
And I think the Rangers
fans might eat you alive.

817
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,059
You're right. I'll stay put.

818
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,019
With my mum in the home and that.

819
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,299
She depends on me for shopping.

820
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,939
Exactly.

821
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,300
So no hard feelings then?

822
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,139
No hard feelings.

823
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,220
Are you staying on for
Tommo's testimonial?

824
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,539
Oh, I can do better than that.
I'm putting you on the bench.

825
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,780
I'm always on the bench.

826
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,179
Well, that isn't what I mean.

827
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,219
Come with me.

828
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,979
Midfielder or striker?

829
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,980
Oh, er, I haven't
thought about that yet.

830
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,860
I'm not as quick as I was.

831
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,540
Oh, I daresay.

832
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,340
But the first two yards are
in the head, boss?

833
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,339
Exactly.

834
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,339
Don't be late, Baldwin.

835
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,579
No, boss.

836
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,939
I'll be there.

837
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,419
Hiya, Mum.

838
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,340
I see you've had a shave.
That's something.

839
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,460
Aye.

840
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,100
I've done all your errands and all.

841
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,380
Have you now?

842
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,700
Can't have everything, I suppose.

843
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,340
Skimmed milk.

844
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,500
Because it's good for
your faulty ticker.

845
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,020
Rice pudding.

846
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,020
Bananas.

847
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:26,140
The apples are tough on your
dentures at this time of year.

848
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,420
And a packet of Immodium for your...

849
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,139
My indigestion, thank you.

850
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,579
Well, well, well.

851
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,419
You could do it after all.

852
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,739
I met Ken Dodd again last week.

853
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,779
He's a very good friend of mine.

854
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,779
The woman that runs it, this place, like

855
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,980
she wants me to come in as Nello
the clown tomorrow. So I will.

856
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,620
That'll cheer everyone up.

857
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:05,220
I asked her if I could bring you
a canary and she said certainly.

858
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,460
I'll fetch you one in.

859
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,579
You're a good lad, Neil.

860
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,419
You know that business where
you wanted to be a vicar?

861
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,820
That's all water under
the bridge now, mum.

862
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,660
I didn't want to be bothered with
doing a degree and what have you.

863
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,460
I know, son, but...

864
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,260
I didn't want you thinking that I didn't
think you could do anything you wanted.

865
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,139
Anything at all.

866
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,499
I'm playing for Stoke City tonight.

867
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,979
Come on, Mum. It's only a testimonial.

868
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,860
Don't go just yet.

869
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,940
No, I won't.

870
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,859
Stay and hold my hand a while?

871
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,739
Course.

872
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,420
They used to call me
Holy Mary, you know.

873
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,059
I know, Mum. I know.

874
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,779
I'm very proud of you.

875
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,019
Nello. Go and warm up.

876
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,779
Nello! Nello! Nello!

877
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,539
Paddy, get over here!

878
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,340
I'm going to bring Nello on, right?

879
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,179
When he gets in the penalty area,
everybody get out.

880
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,060
Let him score, ok?

881
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,740
Now, tell our lads,
and tell the Villa lads too.

882
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,100
Alright, boss.

883
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,699
Nello, get over here. You're going on.

884
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,500
Now, just hang about in
the penalty area, alright?

885
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,700
And cause them problems.

886
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,740
How do I do that?

887
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:05,140
Well you're causing me a problem just
looking at you so it shouldn't be too hard.

888
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:05,940
Ok, boss.

889
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,020
Anything comes near you,
you hit it. Alright?

890
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,020
Right-o, like a brick out-house?

891
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,660
No, no, I mean the ball,
not the other players.

892
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,700
Alright.

893
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,859
Hey.

894
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,860
Score one for your mum, Nello.

895
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,620
Ok?

896
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,739
Ok, yeah. She'll like that.

897
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,500
Good luck, Nello!

898
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,060
Well played, Thumper.

899
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,659
It's Bomber. Like a plane or something.
Not Thumper!

900
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,540
This really happened, by the way.

901
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,540
Did it?

902
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,259
Yeah it actually did.
How could I let the fans down?

903
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,900
Did it really happen like that?

904
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,779
No.

905
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,900
Come on, Nello. Cheer up, mate.

906
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,580
It's only a fucking testimonial.

907
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,139
I think it must have hit
a bobble before I hit it.

908
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,179
Sorry I let you down, boss.

909
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,139
What?

910
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,820
- When did you let me down?
- Tonight.

911
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,420
After I slipped my marker.

912
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,620
I should've buried it.

913
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,660
I don't think slipping your
marker was the problem, Neil.

914
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,499
I think maybe when you fell over.

915
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,380
The first time?

916
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,539
Well, to be honest, I don't think
the second time helped either.

917
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,540
I skived the shot a bit, didn't I?

918
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,780
Aye, just a wee bit.

919
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,980
I think the ball's still rising now.

920
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,380
I think Jodrell Bank
has just picked it up.

921
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,699
Must've hit a bobble.

922
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,180
Blinking groundsmen.

923
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,700
Happens to the best of us.

924
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,660
I wouldn't let it worry you.

925
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,339
All the best, boss.

926
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,459
It was you, by the way.

927
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,299
What was?

928
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,939
Remember when you asked me who
the best signing I'd ever made was?

929
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,179
It was you, mate.

930
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,539
No contest.

931
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,260
- Neil.
- You hadn't forgotten, had you?

932
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,540
I said I'd come as Nello, and I did.

933
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,220
I bought a canary too.

934
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,020
It's not part of the act,
it's for my mum.

935
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,179
Could you come into the
office for a minute, duck?

936
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,299
It was very peaceful.

937
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,540
Yes.

938
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,740
She died in her sleep.

939
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,379
And she died proud of you.

940
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,499
We went in this morning and found her.

941
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,739
This morning?

942
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,859
That's right.

943
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,539
I rang this morning.

944
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,820
We wanted to tell you in person.

945
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,219
We thought it was better that way.

946
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,299
She didn't want me to leave.

947
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,339
Last night.

948
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:20,059
When I had to get my bus,
she... she didn't want me to leave.

949
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,499
- Morning.
- Hiya.

950
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,059
There aren't many mums who'd let
their sons run off to join the circus.

951
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,859
But my mum did.

952
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:06,900
And she used to worry about my weight
and she tried to give me salad.

953
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,540
But she meant well.

954
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,700
And after my dad died

955
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,140
we were a team.

956
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,100
Like Stoke City.

957
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,980
We were a team.

958
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,900
And she worried about me.

959
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,220
And she didn't have to worry about me.

960
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,019
But she did anyway.

961
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,420
And she taught me good manners.

962
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:34,219
And that it's good to be nice to people.

963
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,859
And that's what I try to be.

964
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,980
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

965
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:59,859
Thank you for coming.

966
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,660
Anything you need, Neil, call me.

967
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,260
I'm doing well, though, aren't I?

968
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,340
You're doing very well, yes.

969
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,779
I suppose I've got time
for the choir now.

970
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,740
Why not?

971
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,300
You ok for a lift?

972
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,299
You're coming with me, aren't you?

973
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,860
Am I?

974
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,860
Oh... right!

975
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,619
Mary would have loved the service today.

976
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,739
I'm doing well, though, aren't I?

977
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,620
You are, Neil.

978
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,219
You really are.

979
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:45,020
...in pastures green he leadeth me

980
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:51,659
the quiet waters by.

981
01:12:53,040 --> 01:13:01,220
My soul he doth restore again

982
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:08,099
and me to walk doth make

983
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:16,980
within the paths of righteousness

984
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:23,419
e'en for His own name's sake.

985
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:33,020
E'en though I walk in death's dark vale

986
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:38,379
there will I feel no ill

987
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:44,139
for Thou art with me...

988
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,979
How much did you say it was?

989
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,899
£8.27.

990
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,179
Is Doris not in?

991
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:03,539
SINGING My table Thou has furnished

992
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:10,939
in presence of my foes.

993
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:19,420
My head Thou dost with oil anoint

994
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:25,859
and my cup overflows.

995
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,020
Neil!

996
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,579
Neil.

997
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,979
- Are you going already?
- Yes.

998
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,580
- How are you coping?
- I'm coping well, yes.

999
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,179
I'm doing well, aren't I?

1000
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,980
That's it.

1001
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,699
In you go.

1002
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,739
In you go. That's it.

1003
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,539
Say hello.

1004
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,540
Sorry. Excuse me.

1005
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,459
Sorry.

1006
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,700
How've you been keeping?

1007
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,900
I'm doing well, everybody says.

1008
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,179
I've brought you a bit of shopping.

1009
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,219
Thanks.

1010
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:11,340
I'm a bit worried about you,
to be honest.

1011
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,419
Haven't seen you at the match
the last three home games.

1012
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,900
I've been busy.

1013
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,260
Right.

1014
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,979
- Life goes on.
- Right.

1015
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,980
And I'm doing well.

1016
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,939
So you keep saying.

1017
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,179
How are the birds doing?

1018
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,340
They're doing well, yeah.

1019
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,459
Is that a new one? The white one?

1020
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,820
It's a budgie from Zippo's.

1021
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,780
Norman Barrett give it me.

1022
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,700
It used to be part of his
act but it's retired now.

1023
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,899
Bloody hell, Neil.
Even your budgies are celebrities.

1024
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,780
Right. Freshers week starts on Monday.

1025
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,260
You've got to get down there, snap up
the good players for Neil Baldwin FC.

1026
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:06,539
I don't know if I'll bother this time.
My hip's been playing me up.

1027
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,860
You know your mum would want
you to get out there, don't you?

1028
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,540
Doing what you're best at.

1029
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,579
Meeting people and that.

1030
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,380
She would. That's true.

1031
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,220
No time like the present.

1032
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,859
I don't know about that.

1033
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,539
I've heard the Union are
doing 2-for-1 hot dogs...

1034
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,539
Does that include onions?

1035
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,859
I should imagine so, yeah.

1036
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,180
Neil!

1037
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,020
What are you doing here,
this time of night?

1038
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,659
Waiting for my lift.

1039
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,779
Looks like they forgot.

1040
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,939
Come on.

1041
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,300
You shouldn't be hanging around
on your own at this time of night.

1042
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,700
I wasn't hanging around,
I was waiting for a lift.

1043
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,420
Which didn't come!

1044
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,539
No, but you did.

1045
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,099
What would you have done
if I hadn't turned up?

1046
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,780
You did turn up, though, didn't you?

1047
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,779
I know. But what if I hadn't?

1048
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,979
Somebody would've turned up.

1049
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:24,860
You can't go through life relying
on something just turning up.

1050
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:25,900
Yes you can.

1051
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,099
Well, I can, anyway.

1052
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,740
Hiya, Gary?

1053
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,980
You don't actually know me, but I'm
calling on behalf of Neil Baldwin.

1054
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,180
He's a very good friend of mine

1055
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,140
and I just wondered if you'd be kind
enough to do us a huge favour...

1056
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,500
When do we play?

1057
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,740
Training every Sunday,
matches Wednesday afternoon.

1058
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,380
Right. Well, I play central midfield.

1059
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,940
Oh, you play where I tell you to play.

1060
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,900
I had trials for Macclesfield Town.

1061
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,059
The problem is, son,
I play central midfield.

1062
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,099
This is a wind-up, right?

1063
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,380
I'm just the club president, son.

1064
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,300
It's the gaffer who makes the decisions.

1065
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,020
See.

1066
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,299
Right.

1067
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,420
Thanks a lot.

1068
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,459
- Yeah, thanks.
- See you at the weekend.

1069
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,540
You, young man.

1070
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,940
This is a ball.

1071
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:28,180
All you've got to do is stick that in
the back of the net. It's that simple.

1072
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,300
Neil.

1073
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,820
We're only playing the Christian Union.

1074
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,060
That's part of the problem.

1075
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,739
They've got the Lord on their side.

1076
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,739
You going to finish that pasty?

1077
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,460
Fitness problem, you have.

1078
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,779
I'm going to come on in the second half.

1079
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,899
And play centre midfield.

1080
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,500
I played for Stoke City.

1081
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,100
Let's never forget that.

1082
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,740
No, I don't suppose anybody ever will.

1083
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,340
I thought you said you'd got a ref.

1084
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,820
He'll be here.

1085
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,739
Oh, it's not that lad
from Islamic Soc, is it?

1086
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,700
It looks like a strong wind
would blow that guy over.

1087
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,580
Premiership quality this time.

1088
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:06,820
Oh, right, premiership?

1089
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,179
Hi, Neil!

1090
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,580
Uriah!

1091
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,620
- How are you?
- Alright, Uriah.

1092
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,300
Good to see you.

1093
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,021
This is Uriah Rennie, everyone.
Uriah Rennie.

1094
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,380
- Hi.
- Alright, mate?

1095
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,460
- Alright, Uriah?
- I'm good, mate. How are you?

1096
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,139
Good to see you.

1097
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,300
It's Uriah Rennie.

1098
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:30,060
Enjoy yourself,
it's later than you think.

1099
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:36,859
Enjoy yourself,
while you're still in the pink.

1100
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:43,179
The years go by as quickly as a wink.

1101
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,939
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself,
it's later than you think!

1102
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:56,779
You worry when the weather's cold,
you worry when it's hot.

1103
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:04,099
You worry when you're doing well,
you worry when you're not.

1104
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:10,579
It's worry, worry, all the time,
you don't know how to laugh!

1105
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:17,299
You'll think of something funny
when they write your epitaph.

1106
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:22,899
Enjoy yourself,
it's later than you think...

1107
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:26,019
- Take it again, you're off your line.
- What? There is no line!

1108
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,019
Right, I'm booking it for this end.

1109
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:37,739
...The years go by as quickly as a wink.

1110
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:44,339
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself,
it's later than you think!

1111
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,940
Good one-two...
And a good shot! What a goal!

1112
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,459
What a goal!

1113
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,259
Nello! Nello! Nello!

1114
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,739
Then he ordered the crowds
to sit down on the grass.

1115
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,860
Taking the five loaves and the two fish

1116
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,219
he looked up to heaven and blessed...

1117
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:41,139
and broke the loaves and
gave them to the disciples.

1118
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,339
And the disciples gave
them to the crowds.

1119
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,619
And all ate and were filled.

1120
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,259
One of my favourites,
feeding of the five thousand.

1121
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,819
Now, why doesn't that surprise me, Neil?

1122
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,539
Never trust a man who
doesn't like his food.

1123
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,100
I'm glad you enjoyed the sermon.

1124
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,019
I always enjoyed your sermons.

1125
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:10,099
That's why I told you you'd
make Bishop one day.

1126
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:14,580
It was like the first
time I saw Mark Stein.

1127
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,660
I knew he was special too.

1128
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:17,780
Mark Stein?

1129
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,899
33 goals in 57 matches.

1130
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,619
I made you a card.

1131
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,460
To say well done, like.

1132
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,259
Thank you, Neil.

1133
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,899
Thank you.

1134
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,419
That means a lot.

1135
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,979
And I've got a cockatoo.

1136
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,940
Oh, no presents. I insist.

1137
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,419
- The card is more than enough.
- No, no, no.

1138
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,860
The cockatoo is for me.

1139
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,620
Fossett's Circus give it me.

1140
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:59,219
It's got something wrong with its foot
so it's not cut out for show business.

1141
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:03,539
It lands on my head
every night, without fail.

1142
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:09,500
He said he give it me because he
knew I'd look after it, and I will.

1143
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,100
I'm sure you will.

1144
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,059
Your mum always said you had a
real knack for looking after animals.

1145
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,939
She was proud of me, you know. My mum.

1146
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,339
She was, Neil.

1147
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,699
She was indeed.

1148
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,220
Can you drop me off on the way?

1149
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,780
Well, it's not really on my way.

1150
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,380
It is if you go that way to drop me off.

1151
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,939
Yes, of course, of course.

1152
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:52,059
Can we stop off at the Co-op?
I've got a spot of shopping to do.

1153
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,059
Why not?

1154
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,779
Why not.

1155
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,299
One Neil Baldwin!

1156
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,979
There's only one Neil Baldwin!

1157
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,819
One Neil Baldwin! etc.

1158
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,999
...One Neil Baldwin!

1159
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,499
There's only one Neil Baldwin!
